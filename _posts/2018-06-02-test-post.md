This is a test post. It doesn't have much to say.

Let's say that we're talking about code, putting in some `inline stuff`, what does that do?
Cool, but what about code snippets?

```c
#include <stdio.h>
   
/* good old hello world */
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    printf("Hello world!\n");
    int ans = 2 + 2;  // do very meaningful calculations
    printf("2 + 2 = %d!", ans);

    return 0;
}
```

Nice. Here's a [link](/). But what about an image?

Math is pretty cool.

$$
\begin{align*}
  & \phi(x,y) = \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right)
  = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j) = \\
  & (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
      \phi(e_1, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
      \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      \phi(e_n, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
    \end{array} \right)
  \left( \begin{array}{c}
      y_1 \\
      \vdots \\
      y_n
    \end{array} \right)
\end{align*}
$$

We can also do the math inline $$ 2 + 2 $$, it's also pretty cool.

Discussing a thing that might need some explanation later.[^1] We can also abbreviate things like HTML.

Some text is just so sarcastic that it needs to have a *slant*.
Other statements are just so **strong** that they can't be contained by mere normal weight characters.
Everybody makes ~~miscakes~~ mistakes sometimes.

Feeling claustrophobic, give me some space.

That's better.

Mmm, specifics.

Why would you need this many subheaders.

This is just getting silly.

Finally, let's try listing some things.

The order of these things doesn't matter too much.
- This is a thing.
- This is another thing.
- I'm running out of things.

The order of these things matters quite a bit.
1. *Uno*
2. *Due*
3. *Tre*

Looks like everything is ready to party. Actual post on making this at some point probably?
This one is likely to disappear at some point.
