This is a test post. It doesn't have much to say.

Let's say that we're talking about code, putting in some `inline stuff`, what does that do?
Cool, but what about code snippets?

```c
#include <stdio.h>
   
/* good old hello world */
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    printf("Hello world!\n");
    int ans = 2 + 2;  // do very meaningful calculations
    printf("2 + 2 = %d!", ans);

    return 0;
}
```

Nice. Here's a [link](/). But what about an image?

*wow*

Some text is just so sarcastic that it needs to have a *slant*.
Other statements are just so **strong** that they can't be contained by mere normal weight characters.
Everybody makes ~~miscakes~~ mistakes sometimes.

Feeling claustrophobic, give me some space.

That's better.

# Header
Talk about a broad topic.
## Subheader
Talk about a broad facet of that topic.
### Subsubheader
Mmm, specifics.
#### Subsubsubheader
Why would you need this many subheaders.
##### Eh
This is just getting silly.
###### Nope
*YOU ARE SO SMALL! IS FUNNY TO ME*

Finally, let's try listing some things.

The order of these things doesn't matter too much.
- This is a thing.
- This is another thing.
- I'm running out of things.

The order of these things matters quite a bit.
1. *Uno*
2. *Due*
3. *Tre*

Looks like everything is ready to party. Actual post on making this at some point probably?
This one is likely to disappear at some point.
